# Project Name: Student Grading System
# Description
'''
Description

Create a student grading system using Python that has the following functionalities:
1. Entering the Grades of a student
2. Removing a student from the system
3. Calculating the average grades of students
The user should be able to select whether he/she wants to remove a student, enter grades for a
student or find the average grades.
Also, perform the following as part of this project:

There should be a log-in system to allow only admin access to the grading system.
Make sure you use dictionaries and lists for storing studentâ€™s data.
Use Python functions as much as you can

Hint: Statistics module might be helpful
